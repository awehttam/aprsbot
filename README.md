This is an aprsbot that uses phpAPRS for packet creation and parsing.  The
code is fairly old, but used as recently as 2020 and still starts in 2025
after a few changes.

It can:
 * Beacon
 * Send out bulletins
 * Respond to over the air commands
 * Monitor and record (last heard) nodes
 * Relay to MQTT (disabled in code, pretty easy to find)

I had plans to refactor and build something new from this proof of concept,
but they did not materialize.  Maybe it can help someone else.
